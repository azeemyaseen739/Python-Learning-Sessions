    "### Why Python becomes so famous:\n",
    " - There are some key factors that make python famous;\n",
    "1. **Design Philosophy:**\n",
    " - Python design is so beautiful. Python code looks well-intended and structured. Python is probably the most easy to learn programming language. Python personality is so well commng, and allow the new learners to make mistakes and learn from mistakes. Python give you confidence to write programs with confidence. Python is a easy going language.\n",
    "2. **Batteries Included:**\n",
    " - Python come up with so useful built-in function that allow the user to write programs in an easy or faster way. The user don't have to rebuilt those functions from scratch, only use those function to build amazing things. The philosophy is don't reinvent the wheel use the wheel to build cars.\n",
    "3. **General Purpose:**\n",
    " - Python is the general purpose programming language means python support multiple programming paradigms. The user able to do procedural programming, functional programming with python. The user able to build softwares, applications, programs, and able to work in more domains also with python. Learning python is so worthful, it help you to serve in other domains also. Python capabilities and libraries help you to work in different domains.\n",
    "4. **Libraries & Big Community Support:**\n",
    " - Libraries is like a python file that contain functions that are so useful, and the user is able to use that specific functions for free in their code. Python can contain so much libraries that allow python to serve in multiple domains. The big community support is so well comming, and well come new user with so much resources to learn python. This big community make new tools and libraries and enhance the capabilities of python and solve all the problems of python. This community make the python open source for everyone."

    "### Why python is so famous in the field of Data Science:\n",
    " - There are some factors that make python famous in the field of data science;\n",
    "1. **Easy to Learn:**\n",
    " - In previous time the data statisticians and mathematicians can do data science work, at some time they need the programming language to convert their alogorithms into softwares. At that point they choose python because they see that python is so easy to learn language. The peoples that also come from different domains in data science they start choosing python for it's simplicity.\n",
    "2. **Proximity with Math:**\n",
    " - Python built in 1991, python use in scientific computing in their initial time, because python have the functions and libraries related to mathematics.\n",
    "3. **Libraries & Big Community Support:**\n",
    " - When the people that come from different domains start learning python language, then the community gorws slowly, then the community convert into a python family, then this family build tools and libraries that make work easy of data science. At this time other languages take years to come at the place where the python is in the field of data science."

    "### What is the difference between python & R language?\n",
    " - R language is the good language and contain very good libraries that very good in graphical representation. If someone want to go in PHD and M.tech then choose R language, because researchers always prefer R language to collect primary data.\n",
    " - But on the otherhand python is the industry level programming language, python is so important for the job interview. Python is the overall best language.\n",
    "### why python is slow in compare to other programming languages?\n",
    " - Yes python native data structures are slow, but python have the numpy library that contain andi-array with made with C languages, the andi-array is very very fast.\n",
    " - Python is also a interpreted programming languages, this is also a reason that it is slow, because interpreter execute the code line by line."

    "#### Static Vs Dynamic Binding\n",
    " - Static Binding means we don't able to override the data type of the variable after creation, if we do this we see an error. C, C++, java, these languages support static binding, because they support static typing.\n",
    " - Dynamic Binding means we are able to override with data of the variable, the variable don't have the fixed data type, we are able to change the data type, but python can delete the previous value and update the new value, otherwise it goes confused. python support dnamic binding, because it support dynamic typing.\n"

    "### 4. Keywords\n",
    "#### Compilation Process:\n",
    " - Compilation is the process where you convert your code into binary language.\n",
    " - The words that we use in the progamming language those words are english, because english language is the Commonly used International language and everyone can understand it.\n",
    " - This high level code run in the machine, and basically machine is a chip, like my laptop is a machine that contain a chip a process that only understand the binary language (0 and 1).\n",
    " - To convert the code into binary language pattern, this conversion process is called **Compilation Process**.\n",
    " - The interpreter or the compiler can do this compilation.\n",
    " - let's talk about python interpreter, the interpreter understand the code and then convert it into binary. So, to interpreter reserved some words to understand the code. Those words are called **Keywords**.\n",
    " - In python there are 32 reserved keywords, If we use those words in coding as variable name, then interpreter goes confused while converstion, so it throughs an error, we use reserve keywords.\n",
    "#### Compiled Languages Vs Interpreted Languages:\n",
    " - Compiled languages are those languages that convert the whole code collectively. C, C++, java these are compiled languages.\n",
    " - Interpreted languages are those languages that convert the code into binary line by line. Python, Php, these are interpreted languages.\n",
    " - Compiled languages are more faster than interpreted languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Identifiers\n",
    " - As a programmer, any type of name that we give to variables, functions, and classes in the program, those names are called **identifiers**.\n",
    " - There are some rules for declaring identifiers;\n",
    "1. You don't start the name of the identifier with the digit.\n",
    "2. You only able to use underscore (_) as a special character in the name, other special characters not allowed.\n",
    "3. You don't use reserved keywords in declaring identifiers."

    " - **How python do type conversion in explicit type conversion:** When we the explicit built-in function in a program, then python can create a new object, a new value and then change their data type for a particular calculation that we want to do in a program, python don't make changes in the original value. If we do type conversion through built-in function while taking input from the user then save the value in variable, then the data type is permanent of the particular value."

Whenever we need the variables in the program but we don't know the values of the variable yet, so we pass the none value in the variable to take that variable in the program, otherwise without value python give us error, because in python there is no way to declare the variables, that's why we do this.\n",
